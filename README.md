# Amazon-interview-Copy from LinkedIn connect
My Amazon interview experience 2.

You read it right, I have shared my first amazon interview experience 6 months back, which ended with binary search.

This time it was not from LinkedIn, a recruiter found me on Naukri and said "I have a requirement for Amazon etc" My first thought was, I made a mistake again, I should have leetcoded for two months and put my CV on Naukri. But anyway it's too late now.

I got my OA link in 3-4 days after that call, I was like I have a week, I am going to do it on the last day, because I didn't leetcode almost for 6 months. After 3 days a recruiter called me again said "Do not attempt the OA, the panel wants to directly move you for telephonic screening" I was like (in my mind) " Don't move forward like that, let me do the OA, then schedule the next interview after 1 month, then the next interview after another month, give me enough time"

So I had my telephonic screening in a week, I had a question which I didn't find on leetcode, but I would say it's medium, had to use map and binary search. The recruiter reached next day, said "feedback is positive, I will call you back with the next steps"


Now I'm in panic mode(mostly because things are moving much faster than I wanted them to). A week later, the recruiter said "You will have three interviews in single day" I said "Sure"


## 1. First interview(HLD) : Design Swiggy

I worked on so many food delivery apps before, I felt lucky, gave my design, which is not based on any System Design interview books, straight out of my experience, I felt good. There were some questions based on CAP, sharding, replication.

## 2. Second Interview(LLD) : Design News Feed System.

I didn't work on this kind of system before but I think design is straight forward, so gave a design, Database schema, API signatures. I would say this round was not bad. Some questions based on SOLID, Design Patterns.

## 3. Third Round( DS and Algo):

## Question 1, 
shortest path between two nodes in a binary tree, my mind is already freezing because I already have had two rounds, I was not able to think that much, So I solved with dijkstra's Shortest Path, had to use Adjacency list , priority queue. (Later when my mind cooled down, realised there is a simple solution)

## Question 2, 
given inorder , post-order lists, construct binary tree, my mind is not working anymore, after few deep breaths, I came up with a solution(these questions are simple if I didn't have two interviews before but you don't always have get ideal environment) After that there were two more LP questions.

I felt relieved. Hope this helps.
